# **my endless-sky-plugins**
I aim at developing small limited and modular plugins that don't break vanilla lore too much.<br><br>
When playing a plugin, I often enjoy many aspects of it, but then there is something I don't like.<br>
For examaple... <br>
    great functionality without a lore friendly story, or with a bad story<br>
    a great story with unnecessary or not fitting outfits/ships/functionality<br>
    too massive plugins, only partially good<br><br>
My goal is to get the things i like into the game and let them appear like vanilla game.<br>
Please excuse bad englisch, spelling, grammar, etc... englisch isn't my mother tongue. Feel free to correct me.
