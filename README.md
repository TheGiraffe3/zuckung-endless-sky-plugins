# **my endless-sky-plugins**
I aim at developing small and modular plugins that don't break vanilla lore too much. <br><br>
Please excuse bad english, spelling, grammar, etc... english isn't my mother tongue. Feel free to correct me. <br><br>

### additional.command.buttons

>Made for the mobile version and adds several new buttons to the lower right corner. See the readme for details.

<blockquote>### additional command buttons <br>

<br>

Made for the mobile version and changes the interface by adding the following 10 buttons: <br> 

<ul>

<li>full stop</li>

<li>board ship</li>

<li>land on planet</li>

<li>fleet: harvest flotsam</li>

<li>fleet: hold position</li>

<li>fleet: gather around me</li>

<li>fleet: attack my target</li>

<li>fleet: toggle ammo usage</li>

<li>view player info</li>

<li>fast forward</li>

</ul>

and

<ul>

<li>adjusts the message box to not overlap</li>

<li>moved the hidden ammo box to a visible place</li>

</ul>

<br>

(inspired by theweirednut) <br>

<br>

<img src='https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/blob/main/myplugins/additional.command.buttons/screenshot.jpg' width='400'>

<br>

Allthough most of these commands are now implemented in other parts to the original mobile user interface or can be accessed by gestures, I personally prefer these buttons on the lower right corner.<br>

<br>

Additional there are some functions in this plugin that the original mobile ui can't do at the moment:<br>

- board button cycles through the possibilities <br>

- fleet commands can be used for single ships when selected <br>

<br>

This plugin overwrites `interface "main buttons"` and `interface "hud"`, so it isn't compatible with other plugins modifying these.<br>

<br>

<br>

Chancelog:<br>

<br>

2023-08-05<br>

moved the hidden ammo box to a visible place<br>

<br>

2023-08-02<br>

added new icon and reworked readme<br>

<br>

2023-07-26<br>

added 3 more buttons to a total of 10<br>

added descriptions inside script to exchange buttons functions<br>

<br>

2023-07-06<br>

changed 'fire afterburner' to new 'fleet: harvest flotsam', because afterburner can easily toggled by double tapping<br>

<blockquote>### galactic capital investment <br>

(story, repeatable mission)(made for 0.10.1) <br>

<br>

Implements a two mission chain that enables regular spaceport investment opportunities which result in small daily income. Available in human, quarg and hai space with 2 million credits cash. <br>

(inspired by a-alhusaini's investment bank plugin) <br>

<br>

There are mission for 1 million, 5 million, 10 million, 50 million and 100 million credits. When the mission gets triggered(15% chance), the best fitting credit mission starts(your credits + 10%).<br>

1 million = 600 credits daily <br>

5 million = 3.400 credits daily <br>

10 million = 7.200 credits daily <br>

50 million = 37.000 credits daily <br>

100 million = 76.100 credits daily <br>

<br>

These investments pay off after 3,5 to 4,5 years.
