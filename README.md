# **my endless-sky-plugins**
I aim at developing small limited and modular plugins that don't interfere with other plugins.<br><br><br>


## Plugin List:<br>

### additional_command_buttons_for_mobile
adds the following buttons:

full stop / 
board ship / 
land on planet / 
fire afterburner / 
fleet: hold position / 
fleet: gather around me / 
view player info

adjusts the message box to not overlap

### galactic_capital_investment
implements a two mission chain that enables regular space port investment opportunities which result in small daily income. 
Available in human, quarg and hai space with 2 million credits cash.

Lore friendly, balanced and compatible with probably every other plugin.
(inspired by a-alhusaini's investment bank plugin)

### reduced_automata_destruction
modifies the self destruction chance of Sestor and Mereti ships.

Sestor 349/109/78/71/53/40/27 and Mereti 512/256/128/64/32/16/8 ships have a self destruction value of 0.3 (51%).

### snowfeather_robotics
adds 3 missions that lead to adding androids to the outfitter on Snowfeather(hai space). It's lore friendly, and since korath automata balance friendly too.

Starts on Snowfeather(Bore Fah) after completing mission "remnant: shattered light 4" and have at least one android installed.

### Unique_fix
