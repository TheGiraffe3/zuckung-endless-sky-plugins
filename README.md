<blockquote>### additional command buttons <br>

<br>

Made for the mobile version and changes the interface by adding the following 10 buttons: <br> 

<ul>

<li>full stop</li>

<li>board ship</li>

<li>land on planet</li>

<li>fleet: harvest flotsam</li>

<li>fleet: hold position</li>

<li>fleet: gather around me</li>

<li>fleet: attack my target</li>

<li>fleet: toggle ammo usage</li>

<li>view player info</li>

<li>fast forward</li>

</ul>

and

<ul>

<li>adjusts the message box to not overlap</li>

<li>moved the hidden ammo box to a visible place</li>

</ul>

<br>

(inspired by theweirednut) <br>

<br>

<img src='https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/blob/main/myplugins/additional.command.buttons/screenshot.jpg' width='400'>

<br>

Allthough most of these commands are now implemented in other parts to the original mobile user interface or can be accessed by gestures, I personally prefer these buttons on the lower right corner.<br>

<br>

Additional there are some functions in this plugin that the original mobile ui can't do at the moment:<br>

- board button cycles through the possibilities <br>

- fleet commands can be used for single ships when selected <br>

<br>

This plugin overwrites `interface "main buttons"` and `interface "hud"`, so it isn't compatible with other plugins modifying these.<br>

<br>

<br>

Chancelog:<br>

<br>

2023-08-24<br>

<br>

2023-07-26<br>

<br>

2023-07-06<br>

changed 'fire afterburner' to new 'fleet: harvest flotsam', because afterburner can easily toggled by double tapping<br>

<br>

Unlocking the planet with all ships needs 100 reputation. Unlocking the last of the planets needs 500 reputation.<br>

<br>

The vanilla first contact mission gives 10 rep.<br>

The first mission gives 20 rep and unlocks the first repeatable job which gives 10 rep.<br>

At 100 rep the second mission starts, which gives 30 rep and unlocks the second repeatable job with 30 rep each.<br>

<br>

As a little bonus, the second mission/job spawns a jumpdrive equipped "Lor'kas Ik 577" or "Ra'gru Ik 618" or "Ra'at Ik 621".<br>

Removes the hidden tag from system Devil-Run. It can be found near the core and opens the path to the Deep Space systems and the Devil-Hide system via wormhole.<br>

Originally this system opens during hai reveal storyline, which is disabled because of a rework. Unfortunately some Remnant jobs rely on the Deep Space systems hidden behind a wormhole in Devil-Run. This plugin makes this system visible and reachable(by jump drive) in eastern syndicate.<br>

The Devil-Hide system is also a nice system to farm Marauder Leviathans.<br>

(inspired by a-alhusaini's investment bank plugin) <br>

<br>

There are missions for 1 million, 5 million, 10 million, 50 million and 100 million credits. The chance for the jobs to appear on the job board are 25% for each one. Unfortunately you have to take off and land again on the same planet to clear the mission marker.<br>

1 million = 600 credits daily <br>

5 million = 3.400 credits daily <br>

10 million = 7.200 credits daily <br>

50 million = 37.000 credits daily <br>

100 million = 76.100 credits daily <br>

<br>

These investments pay off after 3,5 to 4,5 years. Higher Investments pay off faster.<br>

<blockquote>### snowfeather robotics <br>

<br>

<br>

Adds three missions that lead to adding androids to the outfitter on Snowfeather(Hai space). <br>

Starts on Snowfeather(Bore Fah) when having at least one android installed. <br>

<br>

To get an android, which is needed to start this plugin, do the remnant mission 'shattered light 4'. Alternatively my plugin 'more.boarding.missions' give androids as rare reward for boarding pirates.<br>

The new buyable androids are a little bit more expensive than the original ones.<br>

<br>

removed remnant mission requirement<br>
