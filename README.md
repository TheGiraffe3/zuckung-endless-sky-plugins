# **my endless-sky-plugins**
I aim at developing small, modular and maximal compatible plugins that don't break vanilla lore too much. <br>
Please excuse bad english, spelling, grammar, etc... english isn't my mother tongue. Feel free to correct me.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/pulls">Pull requests</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/discussions">discussions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/issues">Issue reports</a> are welcome! <br>
<br>
Furthermore i'd like to present <a href="https://zuckung.github.io/ES-DataParser/">https://zuckung.github.io/ES-DataParser/</a> to other plugin creators or people who seek informations inside the data folder. Basically it is a very fast website to view every object of the data folder, especially when you don't know where to find something. Easy browsing of missions, ships, outfits, systems etc.<br>

<blockquote>### additional.command.buttons <br>

<br>

Made for the mobile version and changes the interface by adding the following 10 buttons: <br> 

<ul>

<li>full stop</li>

<li>board ship</li>

<li>land on planet</li>

<li>fleet: harvest flotsam</li>

<li>fleet: hold position</li>

<li>fleet: gather around me</li>

<li>fleet: attack my target</li>

<li>fleet: toggle ammo usage</li>

<li>view player info</li>

<li>fast forward</li>

</ul>

and

<ul>

<li>adjusts the message box to not overlap</li>

<li>moved the hidden ammo box to a visible place</li>

</ul>

<br>

(inspired by theweirednut) <br>

<br>

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/master/myplugins/additional.command.buttons/screenshot.jpg' width='400'>

<br>

Allthough most of these commands are now implemented in other parts to the original mobile user interface or can be accessed by gestures, I personally prefer these buttons on the lower right corner.<br>

<br>

Additional there are some functions in this plugin that the original mobile ui can't do at the moment:<br>

- board button cycles through the possibilities <br>

- fleet commands can be used for single ships when selected <br>

<br>

This plugin overwrites `interface "main buttons"` and `interface "hud"`, so it isn't compatible with other plugins modifying these.<br>

<br>

<blockquote>### automata.destruction.0percent

<br>

<br>

Modifies the self destruction chance of Sestor and Mereti ships to a value of 0.0 (0%).<br>

<br>

Sestor 349/109/78/71/53/27/14 and Mereti 512/256/128/64/32/16/8 ships have a self destruction value of 0.0 (0%) now.<br>

You can easily change the values in automata.txt for each ship ('"self destruct" .0') to a value of your choice. I.e. 0.12 is 23%, 0.3 is 51%, 0.5 is 75%. Its calculated twice, first the chance for self destruction on boarding(i.e. 0.3) is 30%, then of the remaining 70% again 30% chance for self destruction on capturing. That makes 30% + 21% = 51% overall chance for self destruction on a capturing try.<br>

<blockquote>### bunrodea.missions

<br>

<br>

This plugin adds some missions to destroy Korath ships, which enable job board missions for raising the Bunrodea reputation. The first mission is available after the vanilla first contact mission. Doing more jobs will allow you to get access to all their planets and ships.<br>

<br>

Unlocking the planets is based on reputation, so you get access step by step. Unlocking the last of the planets(with the big shipyard) needs 500 reputation.<br>

<br>

Some missions from landing/spaceport unlock jobs. Others just give reputation or unlock story progression. Each job gives 5 to 40 reputation.<br>

Averagely you have to do like 50 jobs, less if you take the fighting jobs. Like in vanilla play, hit spaceport often.<br>

<br>

Since it's often questioned, here is a guide to the bunrodea first contact mission. Travel through Bunrodea territory till you've killed at least one Bunrodea ship, then fly to a human system, land there and you get a mission that mission brings you back to the Bunrodea. You can land on 4 planets now, and at this point this plugin starts.<br>

>Makes person ships capturable. See the readme for details.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>### capturable.person.ships

<br>

<br>

Makes person ships captureable.<br> 

<br>

<br>

Well, technically this plugin disables the person ships, and creates new ones which are captureable (with changed names to "<name> (disable me)", due to limitations of changing parts of the originals). Also adds all of them to the author government, adjusts some personalities and sets all frequencies to 1000. Changed "Tranquility" to have a weapon, so it doesn't flee. And changed "Zitchas" personality to "decloaked", so it doesn'tflee and regenerate while cloaked.<br>

So attacking one of them makes all your enemies, they all try to disable instead of destroying, and they all have the same spawn chance which is in average within 10 minutes.<br>

<br>

At Earth's job board you can find a repeatable job that displays which persons you have already killed, which are alive, and where to find them.<br>

After you've killed them all, you receive a small unique gift.<br>

<br>

I tested this plugin with 10x KIV349, all equipped with Mereti beam weapons, was probably an overkill on most. Boarding "Zitchas"(1000 crew) needed an Echo-Galleon, and I tried it with hand2hand outfits plugin. Maybe it works with nerve gas too.<br>

In cap_persons.txt you find the following line under gamerules: "#	"person spawn period" 2000". If you remove the "#" the spawning speed is increased to one spawn in max a  minute.<br>

<br>

<blockquote>### coalition.shopping

<br>

<br>

Adds all Coalition/Heliarch/Lunarium outfits and ships to 'Far Home' in 'Homeward' system.<br>

<br>

Adds all existing coalition outfitters and shipyards to 'Far Home'. Also adds a new shipyard and a new outfitter with missing ships/outfits.<br>

To start the mission to enable these outfitters and shipyards, you have to join Heliarch or Lunarium (complete the first chapter of these storylines) and own/pay 5 million credits. The mission starts anywhere in coalition space. I added this plausible mission to make the plugin feel less cheaty.<br>

<br>

Completing the campaigns might not exactly have the same result as if the campaign was played. There is a massive amount of events, that might suppress other events, when done on the same day. It looks good now, but not sure if that's really the case.<br>

So lets call this plugin EXPERIMENTAL for now.<br>

<blockquote>### expert.crew.members

<br>

<br>

Adds unique crew members, aquireable through spaceport missions. These crew members are technically outfits which require a bunk and a salary, but no outfit space or mass. They add, depending on their technology field, stats to your ship. Like shield regeneration, more thrust, more cargo etc.<br>

<br>

Currently there are 85 expert crew members. Visit spaceports with an outfitter to find the missions(1% chance). In every of the following regions  you can find 5 experts: Rim, South, Dirt Belt, Deep, Near Earth, Core, North, Paradise, Hai, Bunrodea(after first contact), Remnant, Wanderer(after translation device), Kor Efret(after Rek went to the Kor Efret), Gegno, Arachi, Kimek, Saryd(last 3 after coalition first contact).<br>

Their technology fields are: combat(8) cooling(8) energy(8) engine(8) fuel(8) hull(8) jamming(8) scanner(8) shield(8) storage(8).<br>

In case you can't afford their daily wage you can store them at the outfitter without daily costs.<br>

They have the positive stats of a small human outfit, at the cost of a bunk and a daily salery of 2.000 to 5.000 credits. On a small ship they make a huge difference, while on a heavy warship the stats are minor.<br>

If you collect them all, you'll get a special mission<br>

See <a href='https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/blob/main/myplugins/expert.crew.members/crew.list.txt'>crew.list.txt</a> of this plugin for locations, and stat infos.<br>

<blockquote>### galactic.capital.investment <br>

<br>

Implements a short mission chain that enables repeatable job board investment opportunities which result in small daily income. Available in human, quarg and hai space starting with 2 million credits cash and going up to 1000 million credits.<br>

<br>

There are missions for 1 million, 5 million, 10 million, 50 million, 100 million and 1 billion credits. The chance for the jobs to appear on the job board getting lower with the amount to invest. Unfortunately you have to take off and land again on the same planet to clear the mission marker.<br>

At 1 billion credits a longer mission chain starts and enables a reapeatable job board investment of 1 billion credits. The chain has some breaks and finish after a year.<br>

<br>

1 million = 600 credits daily (60% chance)<br>

5 million = 3,400 credits daily (50% chance)<br>

10 million = 7,200 credits daily (40% chance)<br>

50 million = 37,000 credits daily (30% chance)<br>

100 million = 76,100 credits daily (20% chance)<br>

1 billion = 2 million credits daily (2% chance)<br>

<br>

These investments pay off after 2.3 to 4.5 years. Higher investments pay off faster.<br>

<br>

<br>

Adds a new faction of Gegno pirates which lets you capture Gegno ships, gain Gegno/Scin/Vi reputation, open their planets for travel, loot Gegno licenses and create an outfitter/shipyard for all their gear.<br>

<br>

The new government "Gegno Pirates" inhabit the new System "Zaron"(between Huud, Vesvii and Cotpoxi). The surrounding systems, up to 3 jumps away, have new pirate fleets.<br>

Killing pirates and assisting Gegno/Scin/Vi gives reputation now. The needed reputation to land on the Gegno planets got changed to higher values. Killing like 80 Gegno pirates should allow you to land on all Gegno planets and use their shipyards and outfitters.<br>

Boarding Gegno Pirates gives you a 5% chance to obtain one of the 8 Gegno licenses.<br> 

After gaining full reputation for all planets and obtaining all Gegno licenses you get a mission to a new system with all outfitters/shipyards centralized.<br>

<br>

Warning: As soon as new Gegno story content is added to the base game, it is highly advised to remove this plugin and/or do a new playthrough. If not, the new story missions, which are probably based on reputation, won't appear in the planned order. If you want to keep your save you have to remove this plugin and edit your savegame. To do so ... open your savegame and find the lines with the different Gegno reputations looking like the following lines and change the values to 0.	<br>

<br>

 Gegno 5544.86<br>

 "Gegno Pirates" -4871.9<br>

 "Gegno Scin" 517.5<br>

 "Gegno Scin (Neutral)" 517.5<br>

 "Gegno Vi" 517.5<br>

 "Gegno Vi (Duelist A)" 0<br>

 "Gegno Vi (Duelist B)" 0<br>

 "Gegno Vi (Neutral)" 517.5<br>

<br>

then find the position where the licenses are saved, looking like this:<br>

<br>

licenses<br>

 City-Ship<br>

 Coalition<br>

 "Gegno Civilian"<br>

 "Gegno Driller"<br>

 Heliarch<br>

 ...<br>

<br>

Remove the 8 lines containing: "Gegno Civilian" "Gegno Driller"	 "Scin Adjutant" "Scin Architect 	"Scin Hoplologist" "Vi Centurion" "Vi Evocati" 	"Vi Lord". Save it and then you are ready to start the new Gegno storylines as planned.<br>

The mission can get started with 550,000 credits cash available. You have to pay 50,000 credits for making the contact and 500,000 credits for each of the four licenses.<br>

If you reject the mission, you can restart it on other visits. Also not buying all licenses lets the buying mission on Geminus restart on other landings (until all are bought).<br>

You get the following licenses: Navy license, Navy Auxiliary license, Navy Cruiser license, Navy Carrier license.<br>

<br>

<br>

Planetary map travelling concept : start a new pilot, use 'start: planet.map' and follow the small story line. See the readme for details.<br>

<br>

This is just a proof of concept of an idea by Epsil-Astra.<br>

Basically a planet in a starsystem is a wormhole to a starsystem with changed background, to look like a ground map. The planets there look like cities. The galaxy background is a single whole planet. It simulates travelling on a planet you've landed on. Other starsystems act as different bioms, like forest, desert, sea.<br>

A small storyline got added.<br>

<br>

As in the spirit of Epsil-Astra, feel free to modify/use this plugin for your own content creation.<br>

<br>

<br>

Adds three missions that lead to adding androids to the outfitter on Snowfeather(Hai space). <br>

Starts on Snowfeather(Bore Fah) when having at least one android installed. <br>

<br>

To get an android, which is needed to start this plugin, do the remnant mission 'shattered light 4'. Alternatively my plugin 'more.boarding.missions' gives androids as rare reward for boarding pirates.<br>

The new buyable worker androids are twice as expensive as the original ones, and pay off after like 4 years. Also 6 fighting androids are added, technically they are h2h outfits (with attack/defense 2/2, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12). To keep all androids close a new outfit category "Androids" was made.<br>
