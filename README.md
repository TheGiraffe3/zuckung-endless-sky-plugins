# **my endless-sky-plugins**
I aim at developing small, modular and maximal compatible plugins that don't break vanilla lore too much. <br>
Please excuse bad english, spelling, grammar, etc... english isn't my mother tongue. Feel free to correct me.<br><br>
Speaking of that, I'm looking for someone with great english knowledge(preferable native english speaking), for correcting and rephrasing some of my more text-intense plugins(better.starts, bunrodea.missions, galactic.capital.investment and snowfeather.robotics).<br><br>
Furthermore i'd like to present <a href="https://zuckung.github.io/ES-DataParser/">https://zuckung.github.io/ES-DataParser/</a> to other plugin creators or people who seek informations inside the data folder. Basically it is a very fast way to view everything out of the data folder, especially when you don't know where to find something.<br>

<blockquote>### additional.command.buttons <br>

<br>

Made for the mobile version and changes the interface by adding the following 10 buttons: <br> 

<ul>

<li>full stop</li>

<li>board ship</li>

<li>land on planet</li>

<li>fleet: harvest flotsam</li>

<li>fleet: hold position</li>

<li>fleet: gather around me</li>

<li>fleet: attack my target</li>

<li>fleet: toggle ammo usage</li>

<li>view player info</li>

<li>fast forward</li>

</ul>

and

<ul>

<li>adjusts the message box to not overlap</li>

<li>moved the hidden ammo box to a visible place</li>

</ul>

(inspired by theweirednut) <br>

<br>

<img src='https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/blob/main/myplugins/additional.command.buttons/screenshot.jpg' width='400'>

<br>

Allthough most of these commands are now implemented in other parts to the original mobile user interface or can be accessed by gestures, I personally prefer these buttons on the lower right corner.<br>

<br>

Additional there are some functions in this plugin that the original mobile ui can't do at the moment:<br>

- board button cycles through the possibilities <br>

- fleet commands can be used for single ships when selected <br>

<br>

This plugin overwrites `interface "main buttons"` and `interface "hud"`, so it isn't compatible with other plugins modifying these.<br>

<br>

<br>

<blockquote>### automata.destruction.0percent

<br>

<br>

Modifies the self destruction chance of Sestor and Mereti ships to a value of 0.0 (0%).<br>

<br>

Sestor 349/109/78/71/53/40/27 and Mereti 512/256/128/64/32/16/8 ships have a self destruction value of 0.0 (0%) now.<br>

You can easily change the values in automata.txt for each ship ('"self destruct" .0') to a value of your choice. I.e. 0.12 is 23%, 0.3 is 51%, 0.5 is 75%. Its calculated twice, first the chance for self destruction on boarding(i.e. 0.3) is 30%, then of the remaining 70% again 30% chance for self destruction on capturing. That makes 30% + 21% = 51% overall chance for self destruction on a capturing try.<br>

All starts come with 200.000 credits cash and a bank loan between 600.000 and 4,5 million credits. The ships outfits are changed to fit the role. The intro missions on New Bosten are set as completed. Same goes for the Hai start with the Hai first contact mission.<br>

10 rep for vanilla first contact mission<br>

20 rep for the first mission which unlocks repeatable jobs.<br>

5-7 rep for repeatable transport jobs<br>

10 rep for Korath ship killing job<br>

At 100 rep the second mission starts, which gives 30 rep and unlocks the second repeatable fighting job which gives 30 rep.<br>

### captureable.person.ships

<br>
>Makes person ships capturable. See the readme for details.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>### capturable.person.ships

<br>

<br>

Makes person ships captureable.<br> 

<br>

<br>

Well, technically this plugin disables the person ships, and creates new ones(with a space more in its names, due to limitations of changing parts of originals) which are captureable. Also adds all of them to the author government, adjusts some personalities and sets all frequencies to 1000.<br>

So attacking one of them makes all your enemies, they all try to disable instead of destroying, and they all have the same spawn chance which is in average within 10 minutes.<br>

<br>

Tested this plugin with 10x KIV349 and 10x Model512, all equipped with Mereti beam weapons, was probably an overkill on most. Except for "Zitchas" which needed less dmg weapons and max flamethrowers to prevent its cloaking. Also boarding "Zitchas"(1000 crew) needed an Echo-Galleon, and i tried it with hand2hand outfits plugin. Maybe it works with nerve gas too. Another problem is "Tranquility" which has no weapons and therefore avoids fight. Tested different personality settings and best choice was to let it stay in system after spawn(yellow dot on radar).<br>

Originally this system opens during hai reveal storyline, which is disabled because of a rework. Unfortunately some Remnant jobs rely on the Deep Space systems hidden behind a wormhole in Devil-Run. This plugin makes this system visible and reachable(by jump drive) in eastern syndicate.<br>

<br>

<br>

Adds unique crew members, aquireable through spaceport missions. These crew members are technically outfits which require a bunk and a salary, but no outfit space or mass. They add, depending on their technology field, stats to your ship. Like shield regeneration, more thrust, more cargo etc.<br>

<br>

Currently there are 40 expert crew members. Visit spaceports on human worlds with an outfitter to find the missions(5% chance).<br>

Their technology fields are: combat(4) cooling(5) energy(4) engine(3) fuel(5) hull(3) jamming(4) scanner(4) shield(3) storage(5).<br>

In case you can't afford their daily wage you can store them at the outfitter without daily costs.<br>

They have the positive stats of a medium human outfit, at the cost of a bunk and a daily salery of 2.000 to 5.000 credits. On a small ship they make a huge difference, while on a heavy warship the stats are minor.<br>

See data/crew.list.txt of this plugin for locations, an stat infos.<br>

<blockquote>### galactic.capital.investment <br>

<br>

Implements a short mission chain that enables repeatable job board investment opportunities which result in small daily income. Available in human, quarg and hai space starting with 2 million credits cash and going up to 100 million credits. <br>

(inspired by a-alhusaini's investment bank plugin) <br>

<br>

There are missions for 1 million, 5 million, 10 million, 50 million and 100 million credits. The chance for the jobs to appear on the job board are 25% for each one. Unfortunately you have to take off and land again on the same planet to clear the mission marker.<br>

1 million = 600 credits daily <br>

5 million = 3.400 credits daily <br>

10 million = 7.200 credits daily <br>

50 million = 37.000 credits daily <br>

100 million = 76.100 credits daily <br>

<br>

These investments pay off after 3,5 to 4,5 years. Higher Investments pay off faster.<br>
