			`As you disembark your ship on the bustling Hai planet, a peculiar sight greets you, a cheerful Hai parcel carrier scurrying towards you, balancing four packages on her arms. She stops in front of you, panting slightly, and with a flick of her arms, the packages land with a soft *thud* at your feet.`
