# pillow.py
<br>
It started with testing python pillow lib, and now it can create a jpg of the galaxy with all systems, hyperlinks, wormholes.<br>
It is still unfinished, working on it when i'm in mood.<br>
<br>
How to use it?<br>
Change the path to the dataFolder, the Images path, the used font and run it.<br>
<br>
It creates this:<br>
<a href="pillow.jpg"><img src='pillow.jpg' width='500'></a>
