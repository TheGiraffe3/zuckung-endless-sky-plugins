### gegno.pirates
<br>
<br>
Adds a new faction of Gegno pirates which lets you capture Gegno ships without ruining your reputation. Also increases Gegno/Scin/Vi reputation by killing Gegno pirates.<br>
<br>
The new government "Gegno Pirates" inhabit the new System "Zaron"(between Huud, Vesvii and Cotpoxi). The surrounding systems, up to 3 jumps away, have new pirate fleets.<br>
Killing pirates and assisting Gegno/Scin/Vi gives reputation now. The needed reputation to land on the Gegno planets got changed to higher valuss. Killing like 100 Gegno pirates should allow you to land on all Gegno planets and use their shipyards and outfitters.<br>
Boarding Gegno Pirates gives you a 5% chance to obtain one of the 8 Gegno licenses.<br>
