	description "This data chip contains complete information on the twelve star systems closest to this one: planets, ports, governments, trade prices, available services, etc. You can get all the same information just by exploring those systems yourself, but having a map can save you from making wrong turns if you are trying to travel through new territory to reach a certain system quickly."
