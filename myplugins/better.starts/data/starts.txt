	`You were quiet surprised when you heard the reading of your uncle's last will. Now, another week later, you own a spaceship and 100.000 credits. Unfortunately your uncle had still a a very high debt, which is your debt now.`
	`At the bank, you do the paper works and head to the space port to change the registration of your ship.`
	name
	`You are very happy when you enter the dock. Allthough you often visited your uncle Tiberius here, where he lived in his old 'Argosy', it feels so different. Owning an space ship opens up so many possibilities. `
	`You can continue your uncle's business, by boarding pirate ships, disabled in fights with the Republic. His 'Argosy' is equipped for that purpose. Weaponless, it gives the pirates fewer reasons to attack. Also it is outfitted with many bunks for a big crew and lots of laser rifles. You just need to hire a bigger crew.`

	`You were quiet surprised, when you heard of your childhood friend Ted a month ago. When his parents died, he took his legacy and disappeared from this planet. 
	`Ted made a fortune with asteroid mining, and now he came back to help you.`
	`He vouched for you at the bank so you could take a pretty big loan. He took you to Tarazad to buy a 'Clipper', equipped for asteroid mining. You felt like back in school, when Ted helped learning for your pilots license.`
	`While you sign the paperwork at the bank, you are still astonished how fast the things went over the last month.`

	`With a smile on your face, you head over to the landing pad, where your new 'Clipper' is parked. Ted gave you a lot of hints how to be a successfull asteroid miner. The asteroid beld of Ascella is rich of Uranium and Titanium, two of the more expensive metals.`
	`The future looks great.`
