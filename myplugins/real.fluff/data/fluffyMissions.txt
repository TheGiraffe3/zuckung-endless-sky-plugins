			`As usual, you ask for the details. The woman's name is Rita. She, her husband Owen, their young daughter Sophie, their sparse luggage and their pet rabbit need passage to 'Clark', to Rita's sister. Apparently the family got into financial difficulties here. With the last of their savings they now want to book a ferry to start a new life on 'Clark'. You agree to the offer of 35,000 credits, even though the distance is actually a bit too far for the payment.`

			`You got along really well with the family during the flight to Clark. Rita and Owen tried to be as good and useful passengers as possible on your spaceship since you accepted the rather meager payment. Owen, who used to work in machine maintenance, even made tweaks to your reactor and Rita served you excellent tea a few times. They barely got little Sophie off the bridge; she now wants to become a spaceship captain.`
			`As you say goodbye, Owen hands you the agreed 35,000 credits. You accept the payment and wish the family good luck.`

They say that an invasive population of rabbits, which has displaced the local animals, has just been eradicated on 'Clark'. We have to put poor 'Thumper' to sleep. Sophie then came up with the idea that maybe you could look after him. I would of course understand if you refuse."`
			`Just the idea of seeing little Sophie cry forces you to accept the rabbit. After instructions on how to care for a rabbit and a second warm farewell, you now have a new pet.`

Several crews of spaceport personnel are desperately trying to capture these rat-like animals. You stroll over to one of the foremen, careful not to step on any of the animals.`
			`The worker holds one of the creatures in his hand and sucks on one of the fingers of his other hand.`
			`  "Excuse me, but what the hell is going on here?" you ask.`
			`The spaceport worker looks at you annoyed.`
			`  "We have just unloaded a freighter whose cargo is destined for an animal wholesale company. When we opened the hold, a veritable flood of hamsters rushed out and scurried away in every direction. We've been trying to catch these bastards for two hours. And this little monster just bit me in the finger. Here, take him, I have to get some healing spray now."` 
			`He pushes the hamster into your hands and you practically have no choice but to accept it. As you look at the hamster and gently pet him, you notice how the animal relaxes. You decide to keep the hamster and name him 'Peanut.'`

			`The Hai woman, whose name is Xanua, tells you how years ago she heard a story that there is a species of animal among humans that looks similar to the Hai, only much smaller. Since then Xanua has become very wealthy and would like to score points with high society with something exotic like that.`
			`You agree on a fixed amount of 500,000 credits. Now all you have to do is figure out how to get a squirrel. You've never seen a squirrel yourself and you don't even know what world they come from. You decide to search informations on the next human world.`

The pet dealer offers you to get a squirrel within two months. After some discussion, he gives you the contact details of his supplier. Off to Amazon in the Shedar system!`

They are offering tens of thousands of credits to buy the squirrel from you, which you have to politely decline several times.`
			`When you give Xenua the squirrel, she is completely enchanted by him. In her high spirits she pays you 750,000 credits.`

			`You say goodbye. Back on your ship, you play a little with your squirrel that you named "Trixie". Xenua is right, squirrels are adorable!`
