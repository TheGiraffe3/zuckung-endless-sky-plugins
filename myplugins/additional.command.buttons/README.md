### additional command buttons <br>
(interface changed)(made for 0.10.1) <br>
<br>
Made for the mobile version and changes the interface by adding 10 buttons. <br>
It adds the following buttons: <br>  
full stop / board ship / land on planet / fleet: harvest flotsam / fleet: hold position / fleet: gather around me / fleet: attack my target / fleet: toggle ammo usage / view player info / fast forward <br>
adjusts the message box to not overlap <br>
(inspired by theweirednut) <br>

Allthough most of these commands are now implemented in other parts to the original mobile user interface, I personally prefer these buttons on the lower right corner. Additional there are some functions in this plugin that the original mobile ui can't do at the moment...<br>
- board button cycles through the possibilities <br>
- fleet commands can be used for single ships when selected <br>
- fleet: harvest flotsam isn't implemented yet <br>
