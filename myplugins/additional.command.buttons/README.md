### additional command buttons <br>
<br>
Made for the mobile version and changes the interface by adding the following 10 buttons: <br> 
- full stop<br>
- board ship<br>
- land on planet<br>
- fleet: harvest flotsam<br>
- fleet: hold position<br>
- fleet: gather around me<br>
- fleet: attack my target<br>
- fleet: toggle ammo usage<br>
- view player info<br>
- fast forward<br>
<br>
and adjusts the message box to not overlap <br>
(inspired by theweirednut) <br>

<br>
Allthough most of these commands are now implemented in other parts to the original mobile user interface or can be accessed by gestures, I personally prefer these buttons on the lower right corner.<br>
<br>
Additional there are some functions in this plugin that the original mobile ui can't do at the moment:<br>
- board button cycles through the possibilities <br>
- fleet commands can be used for single ships when selected <br>
<br>
This plugin overwrites `interface "main buttons"` and `interface "hud"`, so it isn't compatible with other plugins modifying these.<br>
