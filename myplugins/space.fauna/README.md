### space.fauna
<br>
<br>
Adds space fauna fleets to all systems. Useless but pretty, to make the universe more alive.<br>
<br>
Currently there are 10 different oranisms, 4 lebiathan-sized, 6 clipper-sized. They are coming in fleet sized from 1 to 5 and aren't capturable/plunderable. There are 4 Hive planets around the galaxy, with increased spawn rates. Uninhabited systems have a higher spawn chance than inhabited systems.<br>
