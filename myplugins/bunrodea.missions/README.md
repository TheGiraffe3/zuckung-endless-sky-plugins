### bunrodea.missions
<br>
<br>
This plugin adds some missions to destroy Korath ships, which enable job board missions for raising the Bunrodea reputation. The first mission is available after the vanilla first contact mission. Doing more jobs will allow you to get access to all their planets and ships.<br>
<br>
Unlocking the planet with all ships needs 100 reputation. Unlocking the last of the planets needs 500 reputation.<br>
<br>
The vanilla first contact mission gives 10 rep.<br>
The first mission gives 20 rep and unlocks the first repeatable job which gives 10 rep.<br>
At 100 rep the second mission starts, which gives 30 rep and unlocks the second repeatable job with 30 rep each.<br>
<br>
As a little bonus, the second mission/job spawns a jumpdrive equipped "Lor'kas Ik 577" or "Ra'gru Ik 618" or "Ra'at Ik 621".<br>
