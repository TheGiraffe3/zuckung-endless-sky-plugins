### bunrodea.missions <br>
<br>
<br>
This plugin adds a mission to destroy a Korath ship, which enables job board missions for raising the Bunrodea reputation. The mission is available after the first contact mission. Doing more jobs will allow you to get access to all their planets and ships.<br>
<br>
Currently there is only 1 job, which is the same as the initial mission. Each job gives 10 reputation. So it's 7 jobs for unlocking a planet with a shipyard with all ships and 47 jobs to unlock landing on the last of the Bunrodea planets.<br>
This plugin is lore-friendly<br>
