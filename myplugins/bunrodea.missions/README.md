### bunrodea.missions
<br>
<br>
This plugin adds some missions to destroy Korath ships, which enable job board missions for raising the Bunrodea reputation. The first mission is available after the vanilla first contact mission. Doing more jobs will allow you to get access to all their planets and ships.<br>
<br>
Unlocking the planet with all ships needs 100 reputation. Unlocking the last of the planets needs 500 reputation.<br>
<br>
10 rep for vanilla first contact mission<br>
20 rep for the first mission which unlocks repeatable jobs.<br>
5-9 rep for repeatable jobs<br>
10 rep for Korath ship killing job<br>
At 100 rep the second mission starts, which gives 30 rep and unlocks the second repeatable fighting job which gives 30 rep.<br>
At 200 rep the third mission starts, which gives 40 rep and unlocks the third repeatable fighting job which gives 40 rep.<br>
