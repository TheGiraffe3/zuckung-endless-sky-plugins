### bunrodea.missions
<br>
<br>
This plugin adds some missions to destroy Korath ships, which enable job board missions for raising the Bunrodea reputation. The first mission is available after the vanilla first contact mission. Doing more jobs will allow you to get access to all their planets and ships.<br>
<br>
Unlocking the planets is based on reputation, so you get access step by step. Unlocking the last of the planets(with the big shipyard) needs 500 reputation.<br>
<br>
10 rep for vanilla first contact mission<br>
20 rep for the first mission which unlocks repeatable jobs.<br>
5-9 rep for repeatable passenger/rush/cargo jobs<br>
10 rep for Korath ship killing job<br>
At 100 rep the second mission starts, which gives 30 rep and unlocks the second repeatable fighting job for 30 rep.<br>
At 200 rep the third mission starts, which gives 40 rep and unlocks the third repeatable fighting job for 40 rep.<br>
At 300 rep a culture conversation starts, which enables the criminal hunting job for 12 to 14 rep<br>
At 500 rep you are done and get the last mission, its an escort mission with a gift at the end<br>
Averagely you have to do 50 jobs.<br>
<br>
Since it's often questioned, here guide to the bunrodea first contact mission. Travel through Bunrodea territory till you killed at least one attacking Bunrodea ship, then fly to the human pirate system Misam, start and land there till you get a mission(10% on landing), that mission brings you back to the Bunrodea. You can land on 4 planets now, and at this point this plugin starts.<br>
