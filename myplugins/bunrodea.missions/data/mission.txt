These people are really difficult to interpret. The queen looks at you and rises from her throne.`

			`When you arrive at the spaceport, you are still in your thoughts. What an experience. Despite the differences, you like the Bunrodea, and they probably like you too.`

As the teams enter the field, some players from both teams begin to beat each other. The crowd screams with excitement. A young Bunrodea sitting next to you notices your confusion.`

The flonk must be brought into a basket in the opponent's end zone, which results in a 'Flopp', for a distance throw, or a 'double Flopp', by jumping to the basket. The game ends when the seventh Flonk is placed in the basket. If both teams have the same number of Flopps, an eighth Flonk is played. Another method to end the game successfully is to decimate the opposing team through hard play to such an extent that they no longer have enough players available. The game is led by a referee. He punishes fouls with giving the Flonk to the opposing team. Since fighting is permitted, it is only considered a foul if hidden weapons are drawn and used. "`
			`You thank the young Bunrodea for that enlightening explaination. Now that you know the rules, you enjoy the game to the fullest. A lot of blood flows over the next hour. Players are carried off the field with serious injuries. And then the blue team wins because all of the red team's players leave the field, most of them carried by medics. On your way out of the stadium, you're still thinking about the game. That was a really strange experience.`

A few minutes later the jungle clears up and you reach a more open area with a stream running through it. In the air, a few dozen meters away, you see head-sized flies. At a closer look, you'll see razor-sharp attachments on her legs.`
			`When a medium-sized rodent is scared up right in front of you, one of the snap flies swoops down and tears the poor animal to pieces. One of the guards jumps forward, grabs the fly with his grasping tools and bites it in the head. The first catch of the day.`
			`A few hours later you load your prey, consisting of eighteen snap flies, into the shuttle. Your armor actually got some scratches, these beasts are really very dangerous. "Isn't snap fly hunting thrilling?" Takeno asks. You don't really understand the Bunrodea's hunting behavior. Sure, it was a nice trip, but the Bunrodea seem totally ecstatic. Maybe it's due to the biochemistry of snapping flies, since all of your companions have tasted their blood with targeted bites. Back at the spaceport, you thank them for the experience and say goodbye. Maybe some day you'll find out more about that.`
