### snowfeather.robotics <br>
<br>
<br>
Adds three missions that lead to adding androids to the outfitter on Snowfeather(Hai space). <br>
Starts on Snowfeather(Bore Fah) when having at least one android installed. <br>
<br>
To get an android, which is needed to start this plugin, do the remnant mission 'shattered light 4'. Alternatively my plugin 'more.boarding.missions' gives androids as rare reward for boarding pirates.<br>
The new buyable androids are twice as expensive as the original ones, and pay off after like 4 years.<br>
