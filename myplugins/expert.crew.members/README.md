### expert.crew.members
<br>
<br>
Adds unique crew members, aquireable through spaceport missions. These crew members are technically outfits which require a bunk and a salary, but no outfit space or mass. They add, depending on their technology field, stats to your ship. Like shield regeneration, more thrust, more cargo etc.<br>
<br>
Currently there are 65 expert crew members. Visit spaceports with an outfitter to find the missions(3% chance). In every of the following regions  you can find 5 experts: Rim, South, Dirt Belt, Deep, Near Earth, Core, North, Paradise, Hai, Bunrodea, Remnant, Wanderer(after translation device), Kor Efret(after Rek went to Kor Efret).<br>
Their technology fields are: combat(6) cooling(7) energy(7) engine(7) fuel(7) hull(6) jamming(6) scanner(6) shield(6) storage(7).<br>
In case you can't afford their daily wage you can store them at the outfitter without daily costs.<br>
They have the positive stats of a medium human outfit, at the cost of a bunk and a daily salery of 2.000 to 5.000 credits. On a small ship they make a huge difference, while on a heavy warship the stats are minor.<br>
See crew.list.txt of this plugin for locations, and stat infos.<br>
