	`You were quiet surprised when you heard the reading of your uncle's last will. Now, another week later, you own a spaceship and 100.000 credits. Unfortunately your uncle had still a a very high debt, which is your debt now.`
	`  At the bank, you do the paper works and head to the space port to change the registration of your ship.`

	`You are very happy when you enter the dock. Allthough you often visited your uncle Tiberius here, where he lived in his old 'Argosy', it feels so different. Owning an space ship opens up so many possibilities. `
	`  You can continue your uncle's business, by boarding pirate ships, disabled in fights with the Republic. His 'Argosy' is equipped for that purpose. Weaponless, it gives the pirates fewer reasons to attack. Also it is outfitted with many bunks for a big crew and lots of laser rifles. You just need to hire a bigger crew.`
	`  Or you can travel into the Endless Sky.`
