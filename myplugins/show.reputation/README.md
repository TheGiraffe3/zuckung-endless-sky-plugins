### show.reputation
<br>
<br>
Enables a job on every planet's jobboard, that shows the reputation values.<br>
<br>
Accept the job, start, land again, and the list of reputations pops up.<br>
Its shows the values in steps of 10, from -1000 to +1000.<br>
I took just the 30 most useful reputations. Full list made landing lag.<br>
