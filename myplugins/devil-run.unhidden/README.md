### devil-run.unhidden
<br>
<br>
Removes the hidden tag from system Devil-Run. It can be found near the core and opens the path to the Deep Space systems and the Devil-Hide system via wormhole.<br>
<br>
Originally this system opens during hai reveal storyline, which is disabled because of a rework. This plugin makes this system visible and reachable(by jump drive) in eastern syndicate. Also removes hidden tag from "Devil-Hide" and "Al Hurr", both hai reveal systems. And the planets in Devil-Hide got a new spaceport, bribe and tribute.<br>
