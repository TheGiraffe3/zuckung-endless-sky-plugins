### devil-run.unuidden <br>
<br>
<br>
Removes the hidden tag from system devil-run. it can be found near the core and opens the path to the deep space systems via wormhole.<br>
<br>
Originally this system opens during hai reveal storyline, which is disabled because of a rework. Unfortunately some Remnant jobs rely on the Deep Space systems hidden behind a wormhole in devil-run. This plugin makes this system visible and reachable in eastern syndicate.<br>
