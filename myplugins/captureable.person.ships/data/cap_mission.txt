			`captureable.person.ships disables the old person ships, and creates nearly identically new ones. This is done because of the heavy problems with modifying npc/fleets. Anyways, just the names got changed. They have a "(Capture me)" behind their names. So persons ships killed prior installing this plugin got re-added.` 
			``
			`Every 10 minutes a person ship has the chance to spawn in the system you are in. The formula for the chance to spawn a specific ship is:`
			`1000 / (1000 x remainig.ships.that.can.spawn.here + 1000)`
			`So lets say, you have just one unkilled ship... 1000 / (1000 x 1 + 1000) = 50% , the other 50% nothing spawns. With 4 ships you have a 20% chance for each ship, with 10 ships its 9% and so on. There is allways a chance nothings spawns, the more ships are alive the lower is that chance, which peaks at 50% with one ship.`
