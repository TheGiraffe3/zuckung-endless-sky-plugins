### control.station
<br>
<br>
Adds a station to the Sol system that offers administrative functions started by the job board. See the readme for details.<br>
<br>
Current functions:<br>
show reputation<br>
show person ships<br>
complete free worlds reconciliation campaign<br>
<br>
Completing the campaign might not exactly have the same result as if the campaign was played. There is a massive amount of events, that might suppress other events, when done on the same day. It looks good now, but not sure if that's really the case.<br>
So lets call this plugin EXPERIMENTAL for now.<br>
